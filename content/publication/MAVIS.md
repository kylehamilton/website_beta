abstract = "We present a Shiny web application and R package to simplify the process of running a meta-analysis using a variety of packages from the R community, including the popular metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2010). MAVIS was created to be used as a teaching tool for students and for scientists looking to run their own meta-analysis. Currently MAVIS supports both fixed and random effects models, methods for detecting publication bias, effect size calculators, single case design support, and generation of publication grade graphics. With this application weâ€™ve created an open source browser based graphical user interface (GUI) which has lowered the barrier of entry for novice and occasional users."
